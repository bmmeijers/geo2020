- 'Semantic classification of point clouds in 3D urban scenes is crucial for applications
  like urban planning and infrastructure management. Despite its importance, successful
  semantic classification of point clouds remains a challenging task. Currently, there
  exist many semantic errors in the existing classification (e.g., classification
  in AHN4 and AHN5). The major errors come from small-scale  inconsistencies like
  outliers, ground points on top and middle of the building, etc. To remove such errors,
  in industry practice, separate algorithms have been developed to identify each specific
  error type. To this end, we see scope for automation using artificial intelligence,
  deep learning in particular.


  In this project, we aim to refine the classification and remove errors using deep
  learning, to help automate the process by detecting and quantifying misclassifications.
  We will use AHN point cloud data, which is the current height model of the Netherlands.
  We will also use the point cloud data from  Rijkswaterstaat and multi-spectral aerial
  imagery.


  This thesis involves two key stages: data preprocessing, where AHN4 tiles undergo
  confidence scoring based on aerial imagery, NDVI, and BAG/BGT datasets; and online
  deep learning, where a model is trained on high-confidence samples to rectify errors
  and enhance predictions, with subsequent validation and testing for performance

  energy demand, performance, and retrofitting applications; noise pollution studies;
  and wind flow and scalar dispersion simulations.


  Geometric primitives in 3DBAG are documented with various semantic attributes including
  the roof type and elevation percentiles of the corresponding buildings. In this
  context, this thesis aims to enrich the dataset with a new label: the roofing material
  type, such as gravel, membranes, metal, sheets, slates, solar panels, tiles, and

  leverages the complementary information of multiple views, by enforcing/encouraging
  multi-view consistency, to improve wireframe parsing outcomes. The potential applications
  of wireframe parsing, including piecewise segmentation of images and 3D wireframe
  reconstruction, will also be showcased in this work.

- 'Multi-view 2D images serve as crucial inputs or intermediate products for various
  cutting-edge 3D reconstruction techniques, including MVSnet, Nerf, Gaussian Splatting,
  and Neus, which aim to recover 3D representations such as point clouds, neural radiance
  fields, and signed distance functions (SDFs) from multiple perspectives. The quality
  of these input images significantly influences the performance of downstream 3D
  reconstruction tasks. Challenges such as textureless surfaces, adverse lighting
  conditions, and shading effects often lead to a degradation in the accuracy and
  fidelity of reconstructed 3D models.


  In recent years, the stable Diffusion model has demonstrated considerable success
  and found widespread application in 3D editing and personalized tasks, exemplified
  by applications like Magic3D, Dreamfusion, and Dream3D. In this work, we propose
  leveraging a generative model to enhance 3D reconstruction tasks. Specifically,
  we employ a stable Diffusion model for image inpainting tasks on input images. Additionally,
  we introduce our techniques to generate multi-view consistent images from the original
  input, addressing and mitigating imperfections present in the original images. This
  includes tasks such as adding texture to texture-less images or introducing shading
  to poorly illuminated areas.


  Our approach aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of employing a stable Diffusion
  model and 3D cross-attention layers in enhancing the quality of input images for
  3D reconstru'
