By gauging various plant traits, plant phenotyping helps unravel the complex relationship between plants and their surroundings, thereby contributing to the field of crop improvement. 

Traditional methods for plant phenotyping typically require field work and manual measurements, which are laborious, subjective, and often destructive. Besides, another limitation is that current methods are often tailored to specific plant species or varieties, lacking generalizability. 

These limitations have spurred recent research into developing high-throughput and efficient approaches. As a critical aspect of plant phenotyping, the segmentation of plant organs is now being integrated with 3D computer vision and deep learning methods. These advancements in 3D plant organ segmentation could enhance plant phenotyping processes. 

This thesis aims to fill this gap by developing a deep learning-based method for segmenting plant organs from point clouds. The proposed method is applicable across multiple plant species. This research will provide a more generalized and efficient approach to segmenting plant organs. It has the potential to eventually impact diverse applications, such as plant phenotype extraction and precision agriculture.";https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/9f475651b1a4de4a505cd7cd7e2a23b1f77231b86ce65e20682857e33fc2cdec/P1_image.png;2024-01-22T00:00:00.000Z;;2023-11-17 15:37:52;2023-11-17 15:45:18;895f3a834e;

In contrast to a ‘prescriptive smart city’ that limits the agency of its citizens. 

In my thesis I will apply this framework to The Green Village (TGV), a living lab for sustainable innovations located on the TU Delft campus to answer the questions: 1. What is a coordinating smart city according to Sennett and other literature? 2. To what degree are TGV and living labs smart cities? 3. To what degree is TGV a  smart city? 4. How can the framework of the coordinating smart city be applied to a real life urban environment? 5.  And How can the framework of the coordinating smart city be expanded upon, based on its application to TGV?

Despite its importance, successful semantic classification of point clouds remains a challenging task. Currently, there exist many semantic errors in the existing classification (e.g., classification in AHN4 and AHN5). The major errors come from small-scale  inconsistencies like outliers, ground points on top and middle of the building, etc. To remove such errors, in industry practice, separate algorithms have been developed to identify each specific error type. To this end, we see scope for automation using artificial intelligence, deep learning in particular.

In this project, we aim to refine the classification and remove errors using deep learning, to help automate the process by detecting and quantifying misclassifications. We will use AHN point cloud data, which is the current height model of the Netherlands. We will also use the point cloud data from  Rijkswaterstaat and multi-spectral aerial imagery.

This thesis involves two key stages: data preprocessing, where AHN4 tiles undergo confidence scoring based on aerial imagery, NDVI, and BAG/BGT datasets; and online deep learning, where a model is trained on high-confidence samples to rectify errors and enhance predictions, with subsequent validation and testing for performance assessment.

This research will touch on the following areas:
- Literature review into existing methods of urban landscape analysis  and stochastic and parametric generation of city structure, road networks, points of interest distribution, building plot division and building generation with the aim to select a range of computable indicators. 
- Development of the analytical framework, incorporating automated techniques for extracting the specified indicators from real-world urban data. 
- Constructing an algorithmic pipeline to generate digital city models based on the framework analysis results.

Except for data storage, it enables users to convert object associations to relations between predefined feature tables based on a mapping rules set consistent to the standard. 
Although the 3DCityDB was developed to simplify CityGML complexity, it still remains complex for users with basic SQL skills. However, a plugin for QGIS, called “3DCityDB-Tools for QGIS”, is developed to facilitate the interaction with the 3DCityDB for a wider group of practitioners, narrowing the gap between them and the geodata experts via a GUI in QGIS.

In this work, we propose leveraging a generative model to enhance 3D reconstruction tasks. Specifically, we employ a stable Diffusion model for image inpainting tasks on input images. Additionally, we introduce our techniques to generate multi-view consistent images from the original input, addressing and mitigating imperfections present in the original images.

The research aims to reveal the specific points within the geo-data chain where people currently shape data visualization. It delves into why some demographics engage less with maps, focusing on readability and usability. The investigation questions if altering map visuals could enhance usage. Additionally, it investigates the impact of standardized practices on user adoption. An innovative approach involves user-generated maps to analyze visualization patterns and find out if active involvement increases map usage likelihood. Emphasis lies on inclusivity and accessibility, aiming to pinpoint areas within the data chain where user engagement could amplify map usability for diverse users.;https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/d5bc8e1b1219399f6635c764e93bb106da5baf830478d4ece4fe4178f117eff2/cadsccsdsdcs.JPG;2024-01-22T00:00:00.000Z;10:00 am;2023-11-16 14:16:59;2023-11-16 15:20:05;391249c0c9;

Two key factors to be considered are the method of assessing the behaviour of the buildings and the availability of sufficient data about building geometries. Given the complexity of the interaction between structures, the ground, and external loading, a robust computational modelling using Finite Element Model is essential for predicting and simulating building behaviour. Hence, the simulation's accuracy relies on obtaining comprehensive information about the physical characteristics of buildings, such as their structural elements. This data is vital for creating realistic models that can accurately represent the behaviour of structures under various external forces. This research will utilise the building geometries information from 3D BAG data. 

The entire process of developing a model of a large number of buildings would be time-consuming, as developing one is challenging enough. Thus, the challenge lies in how to develop an algorithm for automated creation of building Finite Element models in regional scale. This research will assess to what extent the data provided in the 3D BAG data can assist in defining the geometry and generating meshes for a diverse range of buildings in large quantities.";https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/26ce2cec7b7823c2e61a3a16f37d7151a94571bad9219d2eff525bc91ba83824/firstpicture_p1.png;2024-01-24T00:00:00.000Z;between 11.00 - 15.00;2023-11-15 17:30:01;2023-11-16 09:35:59;a8cdea1cf9;
b0l8sfgqbarhbqb0l8g1rbs2t2ffeti7;Feng;Yingxin;5692148;User-guided geometrical editing of high-quality 3D models;Nail Ibrahimli;Ken Arroyo Ohori;;Editing 3D models’ geometry is an important but time-consuming task for architectural designers. The emergence of generative AI methods that enable user-guided model editing brings about new possibilities. However, the current methods still perform unsatisfactorily when dealing with high-quality details and strong changes, which hinders its further appliance. Therefore, the thesis will focus on developing a generative tool that allows users to make significant changes to complex 3D models with easy instructions and obtain geometric-aligned results. Experiments will be made with multiple model architectures and different tricks based on the literature review to find a relatively precise and efficient solution. The major elements of the tool include 3D representation, generative models, and datasets. Implicit signed distance function and explicit mesh-based or point cloud representation are possible options for details preservation. To fully leverage the existing research, pre-trained open-source 2D diffusion models will be chosen for loss calculation. For other steps, models will be obtained from open 3D datasets like DTU. Additionally, tricks like latent space extraction, camera pose and positional encoding, loss functions’ combination, etc. will be tested.;https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/7fc0c2b48ab2be77735e3139ba0762087c5d9907908df2af345a22a5c58a71ee/thesis_p1_v1.png;2024-01-24T00:00:00.000Z;14 (anytime in the afternoon);2023-11-16 09:28:14;2023-11-16 09:31:36;43d55b9a50;
4vejloieno71fsd3cap194vejlo0ppis;Mantas;Dimitrios;5836670;Enriching the 3DBAG with Roofing Material Types;Hugo Ledoux;Weixiao Gao;;"The 3DBAG is an open building model dataset covering the entirety of the Netherlands. It is comprised of automatically generated, three-dimensional geometry at three levels of detail, namely 1.2, 1.3, and 2.2. Common use cases of the 3DBAG include energy demand, performance, and retrofitting applications; noise pollution studies; and wind flow and scalar dispersion simulations.

Geometric primitives in 3DBAG are documented with various semantic attributes including the roof type and elevation percentiles of the corresponding buildings. In this context, this thesis aims to enrich the dataset with a new label: the roofing material type, such as gravel, membranes, metal, sheets, slates, solar panels, tiles, and vegetation. This is expected to increase the overall value of 3DBAG by enabling more extensive and accurate architectural, engineering, and urban planning studies (e.g., neighbourhood uniformity, energy labelling, and urban heat island effect intensity assessments).

As such, roof surfaces in 3DBAG will be assigned a material type by employing state-of-the-art deep learning methods for supervised classification. This task will be carried out using a convolutional neural network architecture such as a residual network or its extensions. The novelty of this thesis lies in the choice of classification technique in combination with the fusion of true-colour or near infrared aerial orthophotos and the AHN4 point cloud for feature engineering.";https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/3daa66ef59b304cdc38bfe00742796d69a0eea3741ffa7bc8e9f4e47ecbeaa5e/p1_summary.png;2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z;11:00;2023-11-14 17:26:18;2023-11-14 17:28:09;6395e78a12;
