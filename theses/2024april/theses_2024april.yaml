  deep learning models to simulate wind around buildings, assessing accuracy and computational
  efficiency compared to traditional methods, and examining factors like mesh settings

- 'Semantic classification of point clouds in 3D urban scenes is crucial for applications
  like urban planning and infrastructure management. Despite its importance, successful
  semantic classification of point clouds remains a challenging task. Currently, there
  exist many semantic errors in the existing classification (e.g., classification
  in AHN4 and AHN5). The major errors come from small-scale  inconsistencies like
  outliers, ground points on top and middle of the building, etc. To remove such errors,
  in industry practice, separate algorithms have been developed to identify each specific
  error type. To this end, we see scope for automation using artificial intelligence,
  deep learning in particular.


  In this project, we aim to refine the classification and remove errors using deep
  learning, to help automate the process by detecting and quantifying misclassifications.
  We will use AHN point cloud data, which is the current height model of the Netherlands.
  We will also use the point cloud data from  Rijkswaterstaat and multi-spectral aerial

  Geometric primitives in 3DBAG are documented with various semantic attributes including

  context, this thesis aims to enrich the dataset with a new label: the roofing material
  type, such as gravel, membranes, metal, sheets, slates, solar panels, tiles, and
  vegetation. This is expected to increase the overall value of 3DBAG by enabling
  more extensive and accurate architectural, engineering, and urban planning studies
  (e.g., neighbourhood uniformity, energy labelling, and urban heat island effect

  As such, roof surfaces in 3DBAG will be assigned a material type by employing state-of-the-art
  deep learning methods for supervised classification. This task will be carried out
  using a convolutional neural network architecture such as a residual network or

- '3D Tile is one of the approaches to disseminating 3D models on a large scale,  which
  is an open community standard established by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).
  Given that large-scale 3D models typically demand significant storage space, the
  effectiveness of these dissemination methods is a pivotal consideration. Utilizing
  generalization and compression techniques can greatly improve its efficiency.


  This study aims to explore a widely applicable method for generalization of 3D models,
  with an emphasis on reusability. Furthermore, the collaborative integration of compression
  techniques, such as Draco, Gzip, MeshOpt, etc., with simplification methods will
  be explored to optimize the overall performance of disseminating 3D models.


  To ensure the widespread applicability of this study, open data will serve as the
  primary data source.'

- Wireframe parsing in images is focused on extracting the structured layout of a
  scene, a critical step in creating detailed yet compact building models. Despite
  its importance, wireframe parsing remains a challenging aspect in the fields of
  computer vision and 3D reconstruction. Multi-view images, on the other hand, can
  potentially help decrease the ambiguity of the detection result with the complementary
  information provided by other images. The thesis aims at proposing a method that
  leverages the complementary information of multiple views, by enforcing/encouraging
  multi-view consistency, to improve wireframe parsing outcomes. The potential applications
  of wireframe parsing, including piecewise segmentation of images and 3D wireframe
  reconstruction, will also be showcased in this work.

- 'Multi-view 2D images serve as crucial inputs or intermediate products for various
  cutting-edge 3D reconstruction techniques, including MVSnet, Nerf, Gaussian Splatting,
  and Neus, which aim to recover 3D representations such as point clouds, neural radiance
  fields, and signed distance functions (SDFs) from multiple perspectives. The quality
  of these input images significantly influences the performance of downstream 3D
  reconstruction tasks. Challenges such as textureless surfaces, adverse lighting
  conditions, and shading effects often lead to a degradation in the accuracy and
  fidelity of reconstructed 3D models.


  In recent years, the stable Diffusion model has demonstrated considerable success
  and found widespread application in 3D editing and personalized tasks, exemplified
  by applications like Magic3D, Dreamfusion, and Dream3D. In this work, we propose
  leveraging a generative model to enhance 3D reconstruction tasks. Specifically,
  we employ a stable Diffusion model for image inpainting tasks on input images. Additionally,
  we introduce our techniques to generate multi-view consistent images from the original
  input, addressing and mitigating imperfections present in the original images. This
  includes tasks such as adding texture to texture-less images or introducing shading
  to poorly illuminated areas.


  Our approach aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of employing a stable Diffusion
  model and 3D cross-attention layers in enhancing the quality of input images for
  3D reconstru'
