Since we have not seen many of you asking for topics around, after discussing in the Board of Studies in Geomatics, we decided to set a deadline to submit a title and one supervisor. 

By first of October, you need to submit your preliminary thesis title and one supervisor to the link provided [here](https://tudelft3d.typeform.com/to/EmoK7SRd)
