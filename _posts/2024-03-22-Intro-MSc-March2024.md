On the 26th of March at 9am there will be an intro session for the MSc process. 

Those of you who are interested in starting your MSc thesis, no matter in April or September are welcome to join. Keep in mind there would be a second intro in June, so no need to rush now if you are not starting in April.

Place: BG.West.640
